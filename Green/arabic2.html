"It all started with a one-time event, when Yaniv approached me to find people coping with mental illness who are involved in art. At the end of that evening, it was clear to us that what had happened had to continue. This is how the “Nefashot” project was born. In my eyes, the beauty and the fun of being part of Nefashot has to do with the fact that we are a people-run, informal and creative initiative.  We are in continuous collaboration with others - and it does not matter if and from which organization they come or what their role is in the system: service recipients, service providers, family members, artists, cultural workers.” </p>

"Being part of Nefashot has been a truly inspiring and empowering experience for me. The Nefashot collective, which brings together diverse participants from the worlds of art, mental health and activism, reminds me that we all need and deserve 'to belong'. Each one of us in the group has a voice and we work together to raise awareness about something as human and as stigmatized as mental health. Through the Nefashot community we have not only built meaningful and respectful relationships but we have also witnessed how the arts, culture and open dialogue can truly transform public spaces into spaces of connection and belonging"</p>
